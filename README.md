# SG Bus Web App

This web application allows for users to query the LTA API to obtain bus arrival timings in Singapore. Users are able to create user-specific views (Multiple number of buses/bus stops per view) and refresh the timings respectively. This is implemented through a database (mySQL) which persists the views a user intends to save and hosted via Flask framework with Python 3.6.

The application is currently hosted [here](https://rodionlim.pythonanywhere.com)
